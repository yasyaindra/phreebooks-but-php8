<h4>How to Install FedEx Shipping/Request a Meter Number </h4>
<ol>
  <li>Through Setup -&gt; Shipping Settings, click on the FedEx Service row in the table and a button labeled Install will appear on the right. </li>
  <li>Click on Install to install the FedEx module. </li>
  <li>Click the FedEx row again and Click on the Edit Button.</li>
  <li>Select True to enable the module, enter your FedEx account number and FedEx Freight number if you want to use the service. Leave the meter number field blank. Select Test Mode and your desired Printer Type. Select the services you want to offer and press Update.</li>
  <li>Request a Meter Number: Click the FedEx Edit button again and press the Request a Meter Number button (which will appear if your fedex number is present but the meter number is blank). An XML request will be sent to FedEx with your company's information (as defined in Company -&gt; My Company) and account number to register with FedEx API servers. A popup window will appear if the transaction was successful with your meter number. WRITE IT DOWN! If you accidentally un-install the module, the meter number is not saved and you will have to repeat the request. Enter the meter number in the Meter Number field and press Update. </li>
  <li>FedEx requires sample labels to be mailed to them to validate the quality of the image. Refer to FedEx.com for further information.</li>
  <li>After approval from FedEx with your sample labels, Edit the FedEx shipping settings and change the Test Mode to Production. You will need to request a new meter number for the production servers before an actual label can be generated. </li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Place the sort order to a number greater than zero. IF THE SORT ORDER IS ZERO, IT WILL NOT SHOW UP. </p>
<h4>How the Get a Rate Quote</h4>

  <li>The Shipping Quote popup will be mostly filled out with values pulled from the order and the shipping defaults. Changes , however can be made before the carrier servers are queried for rates.</li>

  <li>Click on the rate desired and the carrier, method, and rate information will be entered into the order form; the popup will close. </li>

<h4>How to Print a Label</h4>
<p>Labels can be printed manually through Shipping Manager or, for a particular invoice, through the Invoice Manager.
