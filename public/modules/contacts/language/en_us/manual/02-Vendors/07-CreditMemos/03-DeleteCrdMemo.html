<h1 align="center"> Deleting a Vendor Credit Memo</h1>
<p>Sales orders can only be deleted if no items have been shipped from the invoice. If any items have been shipped, the corresponding invoice/sale must be removed before the invoice can be deleted. In this case, the invoice should be closed. See Closing a Credit Memo. Closing a invoice will remove all remaining 'quantity on invoice' quantities from inventory. </p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Vendors Menu, select Credit Memos. The Credit Memo form will load. </li>
  <li>Press the Open button and a popup will appear listing the credit memos for the current period. Select the credit memo to be deleted and the credit memo form will be filled in. <br />
    <br />
    NOTE: Use the period pull down and search box to facilitate locating the desired credit memo.<br /> 
  </li>
  <li>Press the Delete button and confirm the action on the confirmation popup.</li>
</ol>
<p>When an credit memo is edited, the journal entry is removed from the database and the quantity on hand values are readjusted. This action will affect the income statement and balance sheet since a credit memo represents an actual sale (monetary transaction).</p>
