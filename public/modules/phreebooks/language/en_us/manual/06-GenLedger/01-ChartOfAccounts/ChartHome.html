<h1 align="center">General Journal - Chart of Accounts</h1>
<p>The chart of accounts is the key to a successful accounting application. Phreebooks allow for accounts name that include characters as well as numbers. It also allows for sub-accounts to be used later in roll-up reporting. If you are not sure how to set up your chart of accounts, refer to your accountant or use one of the supplied chart of accounts during the set-up script.</p>
<p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Exactly one account of type 'Retained Earnings' may be part of the chart of accounts.</li>
  <li>Accounts cannot be deleted if they have been used in a journal entry.</li>
  <li>Accounts should be checked as inactive if they are no longer used but have past journal entries against it.</li>
