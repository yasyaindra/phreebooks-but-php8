    <p>Prior to setup you will want to ensure that the directory you are installing to is accessible from a web browser. You will also want to ensure that you have access to a database and have the database name, user name and password.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unzip file into the desired directory on your server.</li>
      <li>
        In a web browser, go to the location you unzipped the files to. You should receive a message stating that the configure.php was not found and a link to install the program. When you click the link you will be taken to the welcome
        page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    </ul>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The installer will now check for the required files and directories. If there are any unmet dependencies that prevent continuing installation these will be shown in a warning box at the top of the page. You can click the 'more info'
        link next to unmet dependencies for information on how to fix the problem.
      </li>
      <li>It is common for the mysqli database to be in red since the program may not yet have access to the database. This WIL NOT prevent installation.</li>
      <li>You will also want to look at the bottom of the prerequisites page to ensure you have the correct file permissions set.</li>
      <li>Once all of the required dependencies are met you can click install at the bottom of the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>System Setup</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You will now be asked the enter the directory or http(s) paths you want to use for various services. You can change these if you like but the defaults should work for most installations. You will also be asked if you want to enable
        SSL. Unless you know you have SSL working and want to use it you should leave this set to 'NO'.
      </li>
      <li>Select 'Save Settings' once you have finished filling out all the boxes.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Database Type - Select the type of database you are using from the drop down menu.</li>
      <li>Database Table - Prefix - In most cases this will be left blank. You can enter a prefix if you are using a single database for multiple applications.</li>
      <li>Database Host - Default is localhost but you may enter another host name or IP address if database is not hosted locally.</li>
      <li>Database Username - Username you entered when setting up database.</li>
      <li>Database Password - Password you entered when setting up database.</li>
