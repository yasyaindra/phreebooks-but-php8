<h1 align="center">Entering Beginning Balances</h1>
<p>Unless PhreeBooks is set up on a new company, there will probalby be a need to transfer beginning balances from your old accounting system.   The follwing tables define the data structures required to import inventory valuation and balances as well as Payables and Receivables balances.</p>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p>Before beginning balances can be set up, inventory items need to be imported (or entered) into PhreeBooks. Refer to manual pages on importing/exporting data for the procedure and more information.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If any part of the beginning balances needs to be re-entered, the only option at this time is to purge the GL and history records through the General Ledger -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Purge Journal Entries option. Note that purging the journal entries will clean out the journals and history records. It will not affect the customer or vendor accounts. </p>
<h3>File format </h3>
<p>Type: csv (comma separated variables)<br />
  Delimiter: comma (,)<br />
  Qualifier: double-quote (&quot;)<br />
File extension must be .csv or .txt <br />
Header Lines: 1  (header fields as identifed in the table below)</p>
<h3>Column contents</h3>
<p>Each entry of the inventory beginning balances should have to following information. Required fields are marked with a *. </p>
<table width="100%"  border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap>*sku</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap>*gl_acct</td>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ol>
  <li> The beginning balances script will verify the sku is valid, GL accounts are valid. If any of these are found to be true, the script will terminate and no entries will be added to the databases. The script will also verify the the quantity is non-zero. If a zero quantity is found, the script will skip the entry and proceed to the next entry.</li>
