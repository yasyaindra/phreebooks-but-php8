1.x
November 7 2011.
	* added the payment pop-up to the main template.
	* added a ajax script for saving the pos transactions
		this will stop the screen from blinking can be very tiring when you have to work the pos al day 
	* some added css in the js_include to make the pop-up effect of the main template work.
	* changed the location of the save and print icons. 
		in the payment pop-up you can immediately click on the printing or saving icon
		if the due balance would be 0 after saving you transaction it will be saved or printed.
	* added a line that after a customer is selected the inventory items will be rechecked if they have a discount.
		Until now it only set the customer information and in future sku additions this would be taken in account.
		It will be corrected when the rowtotals function is called but we do not know when that is and it is strange 
			when you mention the amount the customer has to pay and when you see the receipt that the amount is changed. 
	* redirected the pop-up for customer status to the phreebooks module
	* added the strict in the ajax call when the 
	* the calculation method for calculation the discount is changed because when you use a , as separator the calculation got all screwed up.
	* changed the loadskudetails because the first two if statements where not making sens.
		the first always be true because when is called it is set to 0 so it would make more sense to check is there is any value present in the sku field.
		the second if has the rowcnt attached to the sku but the search information would be in the sku field without the rowcnt.
	* i have added "document.getElementById('sku').focus();"
		after the form is cleared and after a new order table item is added.
		this makes for speedy entry without use of the mouse.
